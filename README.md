# FWO fellowship template
*by Pierre de Buyl*

I provide here a style derived from `article` that follows the layout for fellowship
applications to the [{\em Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek}](https://www.fwo.be/) -
Vlaanderen.

- The style is named `fwoapplication`.
- A modified briefer version of the bibliography style `unsrtnat.bst` is provided. The
  modified style file, `unsrtnat-nourl.bst`, and all other files here, fall under the LaTeX
  Project Public License.
- A sample application file is provided in `sample_application.tex`
- Required packages: geometry, carlito (for the Fonts), amsmath, multicol, hyperref, natbib
  and paralist.

# Usage

Copy the files `fwoapplication.sty` and `unsrtnat-nourl.bst` to the work directory for the
fwo application. The project file must use the style `fwoapplication`, as illustrated in
`sample_application.tex`.

There is a sample Gantt chart, for illustrative purposes only.
